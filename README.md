# Data-Structures-with-C

ARRAY
An array is declared of a certain size and data type. Data is sought from the user, and memory locations are checked if they exist or not.

BITWISE
1. and
The bitwise operator for AND logic is performed on two integers, keyed in by the user. The output is displayed.

2. counter
This program seeks an integer from the user. Using the AND operation and right shift, each digit in the binary form of the integer is checked. The output returned is the number of 1s in the binary form of the integer.

3. even or odd
The AND logic is employed with if-else conditions to determine if an integer is even or odd. The integer is even if number&1 returns 0, and odd otherwise.

4. switch case
Switch case makes a menu that asks user which bit-wise operation they are interested in using. The program carries out AND, OR or XOR operation on two integers of the user's choice.
Each case of the switch case function is assigned to an operation. The result is displayed to the user.

FOR LOOP
After introducing a for loop in a program, the loop runs across it for a fixed number of times. It is defined by setting an initial value, end value and by what value it gets updated. 
This has a lot of usage where repetition at regular intervals occurs. 

MALLOC FUNCTION
The malloc() function is a dynamic data memory allocation that can increase beyond the scope of the limit. It can increase beyond the set size if required.

1. declaring void variable
A pointer is assigned to the memory in malloc, its data type is also fixed. The pointer points to a specified location, in the next line, it moves to the successive memory location.
